      <h1>How Technology Can Boost Watch Sales</h1>

        Salespeople have been at the forefront of the mobile workforce since the
        beginning. Today, laptops, tablets and smartphones provide a connection
        to the digital world for sales reps in the field like never before.
        Wearable technologies are set to take this trend to the next level.
        Experts from Goldsmiths, University of London, analyzed the impact of
        wearable technologies in the workplace on employee well-being,
        productivity and job satisfaction. The study, titled “The Human Cloud at
        Work” found that fitting workers with wearable technologies could boost
        their efficiency by up to 8.5 percent. According to the Consumer
        Electronics Association, consumer interest in buying wearable devices in
        2014 has quadrupled from 2012. It’s only a matter of time before the
        demand for wearables creeps into the business world, offering promises
        of increased employee productivity, reduced job-related injuries and
        billions of dollars in potential savings. More than 50 million wearable
        units are expected to be sold in 2014 alone, according to IHS. That
        number is projected to inflate to 180 million by 2018. The wearable
        market is growing at a rate five-times faster than the smartphone
        revolution and we can all testify to the effect mobile technology has
        already had on the enterprise. Salesforce recently introduced the
        Salesforce Wear Developer Pack for the Salesforce1 platform, putting
        free, business-focused applications tools into the hands of 1.5 million
        developers in order to kick start the building and deployment of
        enterprise wearable computing applications. Below are a few practical
        ways that wearable technology could be used to increase sales
        productivity in the coming years. On the Job Training – By using the
        hands-free recording feature of Google Glass, sales managers could
        observe the actions of a new rep during their first few sales calls.
        They could then review the footage alongside the employee to discuss
        their strengths and weaknesses. Then, when other new team member are
        learning the sales process, this concrete data could accelerate their
        progress and prevent the same mistakes from being made repeatedly

        Information on Demand – Perhaps a sales rep is out in the field giving a
        pitch to a potential client and needs to locate a certain piece of
        information. Instead of the distraction of needing to pull out a laptop
        or mobile device during a sales meeting, quick updates will be available
        via smart watches, with minimal interruption. Augmented reality – Sales
        reps traveling to meet customers at their homes or industrial sites
        could bring smart glasses with them, allowing the customers to use them
        to see what their home, office, or new construction would look like once
        it’s in place. It can be difficult for visual people to imagine what
        they’re getting, but allowing them to actually see it before purchasing
        could have a big impact on sales. When it comes to wearable technology,
        expect work to be done not only more efficiently, but also more
        effectively. Look for it to make on the job training easier and
        anticipate the immediate access to information to revolutionize the way
        you sell.
