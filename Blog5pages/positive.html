      <h1>Positive Impact of Technology in watch industry</h1>

        Watches are one of the many things in demand today. Aside from helping
        people tell time, they can also be used as a fashion statement. There
        are different types of watches and some are very expensive, depending on
        the brand and model you choose to purchase. Over time, there have been
        new developments in watch design, thanks in large part to technology.
        With unlimited possibilities, technology has elevated how watches are
        made and molded into perfection
      </p>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Here's how: Enabled Mass Production One of the questions you might be
        thinking of is, “How does technology affect the production of watches,
        as well as its impact on manufacturing?” There used to be a time when
        all watches were handcrafted by skilled craftsmen on a large scale.
        However, nowadays, watches are mass produced in factories. As
        manufacturing became more mechanized, watch production became cheaper as
        well, leading to a lower quality. On the other hand, watches made by
        hand, while fewer than the mass-produced ones, may be considered as
        luxury items because of the craftsmanship applied in their creation.
        Developed Automation As watch making became more mechanized, watchmakers
        started automating the process. Watches began as simple time pieces, but
        later, designers started adding new features.
        <br /><br />
        The first watches are not the wristwatches we know today but alarm
        clocks. Soon, watch makers added date functions and, eventually,
        built-in calendars, which are some of the advantages of tactical
        watches. Watch makers started automating the actual movements of the
        watches. This gave manufacturers a chance to focus more on the features
        of the watches rather than the movements. Currently, majority of the
        watches today are made with a stopwatch or a timer function built into
        the face. While watches are a time piece, making them has also
        progressed to becoming a hobby. This hobby, then, allows watch makers to
        add more features to their creations in order to enhance and further its
        function. Increased Complexity Technology’s impact on watches is not
        just limited to how a piece looks. Over the past century or so, watches
        have become more complex. Today’s watches can do everything from showing
        the time to surfing the Internet. Smart watches can even measure your
        heart rate and the number of steps you take in a day. As watches become
        more intricate, watch makers needed to find ways to make these complex
        details functional. Also, the manufacturing processes a watch undergoes
        determines how valuable they are. The cost of a watch will often be
        based on its features, as well as its overall durability. More Materials
        Are Used Watches are important to people because they are an expression
        of how they feel, where they are headed, and who they are as a person.
        In addition to how watches are made, the way watches are worn is equally
        as important. The type of materials used in the construction of a watch
        and the way those materials are treated have an impact on how they wear
        and look. For instance, the materials that are used in the many watches
        can affect how long a watch is able to maintain its precision. Certain
        materials such as sapphire is extremely hard, thus increasing the
        watch’s precision. Enhanced Precision Speaking of precision, when it
        comes to how watches are made today, precision is everything. Because of
        this, watch manufacturers are always looking for ways to increase the
        accuracy of their watches.<br /><br />
        In response to this, companies are working hard to develop new materials
        and methods of using these to increase the precision of a watch while
        keeping it at a reasonable price. Use Of Nanotechnology There are what
        we now consider smart watches, and one of the ways to increase the
        precision of a watch without having to hike the cost is through the use
        of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is used in many forms, including the
        creation of watches. In simple terms, nanotechnology is the study of
        small nanotubes and how these tiny tubes are manipulated into the right
        size and shape so that they can function like watch’s mechanism. For
        this to happen, a watch needs to have a circuit board that has nanotubes
        printed onto it. Nanotechnology is an exciting topic in which many
        different technological advances are being made. As more
        nanotechnologies are developed, the accuracy of how watches work will
        also improve. This is why future watches will be made with
        nanotechnologies since it helps increase the precision of how it
        functions. And soon, we will be able to look into the future and see how
        watches will function even more accurately.
