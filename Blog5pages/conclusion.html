      <h1>Overall Conclusion on Technology in the Watch Industry</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="image"></div>
    <p class="author">By Prakriti Katwal | 1 February, 2025</p>

        Humans have relied on all kinds of methods to keep track of time over
        the centuries. The earliest known timekeeping method was the ancient
        sundial, used in Egypt around 1500 BC. Portable pocket watches began
        emerging in the 16th century. They were large and bulky and only used by
        the wealthy. The use of brass and steel was introduced in the 17th and
        18th centuries as technology advanced, enabling the birth of smaller
        timepieces. One major revelation in the history of timekeeping was the
        innovation of a tiny pendulum device known as the balance spring. It was
        invented in 1675 by a man named Christian Huygens and significantly
        improved the accuracy of watch mechanisms thereafter. The Industrial
        Revolution during the 18th Century marked the emergence of the
        wrist-worn watch as we know it today. Designed for convenience during
        World War I, these early wristwatches promised soldiers a quick and easy
        way to check the time while out on the battlefield. During the 20th
        Century, heritage brands like Omega and Patek Philippe began introducing
        artistically crafted marvels. Their intricate complications were not
        only functional but incredibly beautiful and artistic too. Watch-wearing
        became fashionable, enjoyable and exciting. Wearing a timepiece was no
        longer just about reading the time, but about wearing a symbol of style
        and status.

        As mentioned, it was during the 18th and 19th centuries that the
        watchmaking sector underwent a significant change. The Industrial
        Revolution was key to the emergence of some of the world’s most iconic
        watch brands. The way we produced watches also changed. Suddenly, thanks
        to technological advancements, it became more economical to mass-produce
        standardised watch parts. Watchmaking as a bespoke craft began to fizzle
        out, and soon, watches could be manufactured on a mass scale and fast!
        This transition from artisanal watchmaking to the industrialisation of
        the craft, in turn, made watches more accessible to a wider audience
        thanks to their affordability and availability. During this time, many
        notable watch manufacturers emerged. Subsequently, they became industry
        icons – names that we all recognise today. Examples of these include
        Rolex, Audemars Piguet and Patek Philippe among many others. Having set
        benchmarks for excellence in the industry, these leading manufacturers
        were committed to developing watches that epitomised values in quality,
        reliability, innovation and precision. Other leaders in the field of
        watchmaking during this time included A. Lange & Söhne, Breitling,
        Panerai, and Breguet, all of whom are still manufacturing luxury
        timepieces today.
