      <h1>Negative Impact of Technology in watch industry</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="image"></div>

        Unfortunately, that’s often not the case. Apart from a handful of
        forward- thinking brands and a rapidly growing secondhand market, the
        watch industry is lagging far behind when it comes to sustainable
        development. Nearly every major watch brand was labeled
        “non-transparent” when it came to sharing their companies’ environmental
        standards and practices, according to the World Wildlife Fund’s most
        recent assessment of the market. Overall, there is a lack of “good
        environmental standards,” according to the report. The truth is that the
        watch industry, in large part, hasn’t taken sustainability seriously.
        For most purveyors, sustainable development is often seen as an add-on
        in the form of a limited-edition timepiece with a portion of the
        proceeds going to a good climate cause, a more energy-efficient
        facility, or a reduction in packaging. These initiatives are
        commendable, but not nearly enough to have a significant impact. IWC was
        commended for its respect of governance structure and policies, its due
        diligence when working with suppliers including third-party external
        audits, its enforcing of environmental standards in its supply chain and
        its setting of goals for greenhouse gas emissions. It was also the only
        watch brand to publish its own Sustainability Report. “At IWC,
        sustainability means caring for our people, customers and the world we
        live in,” said Franziska Gsell (pictured above), IWC’s Chief Marketing
        Officer and Sustainability Committee Chair. “We commit ourselves to
        transparency and respectful handling of natural resources with the
        understanding that doing so helps us prosper over the long term.”

        Another brand to note is the newcomer Baume. Launched in 2018, Baume
        developed a business model that uses recycled materials, avoids precious
        metals and applies a made-to-order system. The brand has also steered
        clear of the use of leather and alligator skins in favor of cotton,
        cork, linen and recycled PET straps. Another sustainable development
        success story in the watch industry is the secondhand market. This
        billion-dollar sector is largely managed by third-party vendors such as
        Watchbox, Watchfinder & Co. and Chrono24. Selling and buying vintage
        timepieces avoids producing new items and therefore doesn’t have an
        additional negative impact on the environment, making a vintage watch an
        excellent sustainable purchase. When making a new watch purchase, the
        important thing is not to be afraid to ask questions about the origin of
        materials. Even if the salesperson doesn’t have the answer, or the right
        answer, the more people who ask, the more the luxury brands will start
        to realize that fighting climate change and global warming isn’t just
        happening in the mines, but also over the shop counter.

        The main concern for the watch industry comes from the sourcing of raw
        materials. The watch and jewelry industries use around 50 percent of the
        world’s gold and 67 percent of its newly-mined rough diamonds, and yet
        when asked where their raw materials come from, most are incapable of
        answering, blindly trusting their suppliers to be responsible on their
        behalf. The mining of raw materials for watch cases can cause dramatic
        environmental damage, including air and water pollution, soil
        degradation, movements of landmass and deforestation that all contribute
        to fragmenting and destroying ecosystems and result in negative effects
        on freshwater, forests and wildlife. Add to this the risks of human
        rights violations and it is surprising that luxury brands aren’t paying
        closer attention to their sourcing. The WWF report revealed that five
        out of 12 companies analyzed had no formal and transparent approach to
        environmental management policies, with no means to measure and manage
        their environmental impacts. Despite this scary picture, a small handful
        of luxury brands are starting to stand out from the crowd, such as the
        Swiss watch and jewelry company Chopard. In 2013, Chopard partnered with
        Eco-Age, a sustainable luxury consultancy firm, to work on a multi-year
        program towards the responsible sourcing of gold. The company joined
        forces with the Alliance for Responsible Mining to support mining
        communities with training, social assistance and environmental advice so
        that they could obtain the ethical Fairmined Gold certification.
